# Unexpected Behavior with the `arguments` object in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript related to the `arguments` object.  The `arguments` object in JavaScript is not a true array, and using it as such can lead to unexpected results.

## The Bug

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple function that attempts to treat the `arguments` object as an array. This leads to unexpected behavior, especially when using array methods. 

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers the solution.  The key is to convert the `arguments` object to a real array using methods like `Array.from()` or the spread syntax (`...`). This allows you to leverage standard array methods reliably.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.js` file. Observe the output, noting the unexpected result.
3. Run the `bugSolution.js` file.  Observe the correct output.
